# Bingo Leaderboard
A leaderboard page for Ocarina of Time Bingo races, with a Java backend and React.js frontend. It automatically fetches data from [Racetime.gg](https://www.racetime.gg) once a day and calculates a score for each Bingo player based on their 15 most recent races.

The leaderboard can be viewed live at [https://xwmtp.github.io/bingo-leaderboard](https://xwmtp.github.io/bingo-leaderboard)
